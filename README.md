### A color picker, but in real life?

Yes! You can now get an idea and hex color of what color you see in the real world.

Inspired from the concept [ScribblePen](https://scribblepen.com/)


### Idea behind
> I saw a color in my university and was very curious about what color it could be and how can i implement in one of my designs. but i can't take my phone and pick the color on the fly. I have to take a picture and run into a hex picker. Image processing takes place in that method too! So it can never be near-to-perfect. So here we are

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This can never be an accurate color picker as camera sensor, lighting conditions can take a hit on the color accuracy! It can still give a near-to-perfect color code tho. Trust your eyes âœ¨
